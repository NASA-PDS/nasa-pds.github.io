Contribute
==========

We are always looking for community input into our software. Feel free to contribute to the PDS repos:

* Contribute to this documentation: https://github.com/NASA-PDS/NASA-PDS.github.io
* Contribute to a specific software project: https://github.com/NASA-PDS

Within the NASA Planetary Data System, we value the people who comprise our team as well as *everyone* who wishes to contribute to our software. The *health of that community* is just as important as code, bug fixes, documentation changes, and other contributions. To that end, we have established the following guidelines:

* A `contributor's guide`_ that gives delineates the kinds of contributions we welcome.
* A `code of conduct`_ that describes the standards of behavior we practice and are willing to accept in our community.
