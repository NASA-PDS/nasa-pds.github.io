  <br/>

The Planetary Data System (PDS) is a long-term archive of digital data products returned from NASA's planetary missions, and from other kinds of flight and ground-based data acquisitions, including laboratory experiments. But it is more than just a facility - the archive is actively managed by planetary scientists to help ensure its usefulness and usability by the world wide planetary science community.

The following page outlines the planned PDS software enhancements, bug fixes, and impacted requirements for the upcoming Build .

A more detailed breakdown of these tasks by date and priority can be found in our `Zenhub Roadmap <https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/pdsen-workspace-5c87e859b7a0872dd10b87c5/roadmap>`_ (login required).

Planned PDS4 Information Model Changes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This section details the planned changes to the PDS4 Information Model for this build. These changes are deliverables by the PDS Data Design Working Group (DDWG) to the Engineering Node for implementation.

* `validate#482 <https://github.com/NASA-PDS/validate/issues/482>`_ **As a user, I want to validate lblx file extension as a PDS4 label  (CCB-260)**



Planned Software Changes
++++++++++++++++++++++++

This section details the planned software changes for this build.

Planned tasks for the next release cycle are grouped by software component, and sub-tasks are included where known at the time of this plan generation. Each section also includes additional information, such as:

* Software description
* Link to |:mag:| User Guide
* Link to |:computer:| Github Repo
* Link to |:ambulance:| Issue Tracking
* Link to |:ledger:| Backlog - future work not planned for this release cycle

**Don't see the tool you are looking for?** This means there is no active development planned for this build cycle. Head to the `PDS Tool Registry <https://pds.nasa.gov/tools/tool-registry/>`_ to see all possible tools available for PDS data.

**Have a new feature or tool you think we should be working on?** Create a ticket in the applicable Github repo or in our `PDS EN Operations repo <https://github.com/NASA-PDS/pdsen-operations/issues/new/choose>`_ and we will see how that can fit into our plans moving forward.
